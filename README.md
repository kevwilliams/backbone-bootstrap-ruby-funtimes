Backbone / Bootstrap / Ruby Funtimes
================================

Some fun stuff with Backbone/Bootstrap and Ruby

This started out as the Defcon Zappos challenge written in Java. That little project was a challenge by my wife to create something fun in Java for Zappos.

I was already preparing for Defcon 22 so made this little app to help me find a wardrobe.

After looking around the insider program some more I learned about Backbone, and saw that Ruby is a Zappos Friendly language so put some time into making this version.

Basically I created a quick scraper in Ruby using Mechanize that gets a bunch of Zappos products, and a Backbone JS interface with Bootstrap to be the presentation layer.

Ruby is fun, Backbone is awesome and Bootstrap is solid as always. Lots of fun was had here. I'll probably tinker on this a fair bit.
